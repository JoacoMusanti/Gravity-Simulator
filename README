newtonian gravity simulator v2.0.0

What does this program do?
--------------------------

This program simulates the gravitational interaction between particles in a scene
using the Newton laws of gravity and motion. The user can add any particles they want
to the scene and they can specify the particle's name, mass, position and initial velocity.
They can also save the current scene with all its particles and their current states
to a file so that it can be loaded later. 

Dependencies
------------

This program requires GLFW and freeglut.

GLFW:

http://www.glfw.org/

You can also use NuGet to acquire the packages

Compilation and installation
----------------------------

To compile the program, first make sure to meet all the dependencies mentioned above.
Then, navigate to the program's main directory, ex:

    $ cd newton_current_yyyy_mm_dd/

and execute the following commands:

    $ autoreconf -i
    $ ./configure
    $ make

make will create a binary file called newton inside the src/ directory, if you want to
run the program from there you can do so. If, however, you want to execute the program
from some other place, you can run:

    # make install

This will install the program in /usr/local/bin/ by default.

You can also compile this software using Visual Studio by opening the solution file
newton.sln, setting up the references to external libraries and compiling.
