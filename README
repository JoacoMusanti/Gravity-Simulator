newtonian gravity simulator v2.0.0

What does this program do?
--------------------------

This program simulates the gravitational interaction between particles in a scene
using the Newton laws of gravity and motion. The user can add any particles they want
to the scene and they can specify the particle's name, mass, position and initial velocity.
They can also save the current scene with all its particles and their current states
to a file so that it can be loaded later. All the particles are point-like, so no collision
detection is done. 

Dependencies
------------

This program requires the Boost libraries and GLFW.

Boost:

http://www.boost.org/

NOTE: This program only uses boost::system and boost::thread, so if you
don't want to compile the entire Boost libraries you can compile and install only those
mentioned above.

GLFW:

http://www.glfw.org/

Compilation and installation
----------------------------

To compile the program, first make sure to meet all the dependencies mentioned above.
Then, navigate to the program's main directory, ex:

    $ cd newton_current_yyyy_mm_dd/

and execute the following commands:

    $ autoreconf -i
    $ ./configure
    $ make

make will create a binary file called newton inside the src/ directory, if you want to
run the program from there you can do so. If, however, you want to execute the program
from some other place, you can run:

    # make install

This will install the program in /usr/local/bin/ by default.
